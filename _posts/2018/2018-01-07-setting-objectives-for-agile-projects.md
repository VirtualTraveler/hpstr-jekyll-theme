Most Agile methodologies omit a crucial aspect of successful software development - How to define measurable objectives for an initiative and use them to ensure alignment with business goals. When agile projects are aligned with well defined objectives they become a powerful business tool. Without such alignment they can drift off-target and fail to deliver the intended outcomes. 

The Agile movement has revolutionized the development of software. It is clearly better than traditional alternatives. Organizations representing the full range of industries, business models, and sizes are using Agile. But, they aren't all  doing it the same way. There are many variants of the approach each with differing benefits. Overall the approach remains robustly effective, despite significant variation in implementation.

The practices and principles embodied in the Agile approach existed long before the [Agile Manifesto (2001)](http://agilemanifesto.org/). In his 1988 book The Principles of Software Engineering Management [Tom Gilb](https://www.gilb.com/) dedicated a chapter to Evolutionary Delivery in which he describes the critical concepts of of an Evolutionary Delivery approach as 

> 1. Multi-objective driven
2. Early, frequent iteration
3. Complete analysis, design, build and test in each step
4. User orientation
5. Systems approach, not merely algorithm orientation
6. Open-ended basic systems architecture
7. Results orientation, not software development process orientation 

These concepts overlap significantly with Agile Principles. The writers of the Agile manifesto cite Gilb as an influence, and Gilb himself quotes earlier work by Demming. Other examples of Agile-like approaches, stretching back many years, can be found in non-software engineering history books. But Gilb's call for and approach that is objective-driven and results-orientated seems to have been ignored in favor of a focus on features over outcomes.  

The collection of practices embodied in Agile and similar approaches has been co-evolving for many years. They work well together. Now that these practices have a collective name "Agile" they are starting to spread outside engineering into other areas of business. But this does not mean they are complete or perfect. They are merely a step on a path towards better engineering practices. In choosing how we might improve Agile it is important to remember what makes it so effective. 

**Agile is Human Scaled and Transparent**

Each individual on an agile team can see how their contribution, and that of their peers, create value. Agile teams are small enough that each individual can have a positive impact, and no individual can hide their weaknesses. Time scales are short enough for feedback to be meaningful and actionable. The team can individually, and collectively, learn from it's mistakes, hopefully, fast enough to make a difference. People who like teamwork like Agile. 

**Agile is Easy to Explain and Self-Correcting**

It is easy to communicate the basic principles and practices. It is much harder to explain why these practices work. The benefits of the approach are emergent - practices interact in various ways to create benefits that are not predictable before hand. This is why so many zealots demand complete adherence to their flavor of Agile - they can't explain how the benefits arise from the practices, because they emerge from a complex interaction of many factors. In reality it doesn't much matter where you start. Not only do the practices lead to emergent benefits, they act as an attractor that pulls and pushes teams toward an ever more effective Approach. The practices are valuable individually and are self-reinforcing, becoming even more valuable collectively. 

**Agile Drives the Evolution of Solutions and Teams**

Agile can be employed to evolve better solutions in a rapidly changing environment of shifting goals, objectives, and requirements. But there is more than one reason why a team may lack a clear understanding of what it is trying to achieve. 

When a novice team is uncertain of how to deliver a well understood solution an agile approach forces the team to continually confront their own lack of skill, to fail in small recoverable steps, thus allowing them to succeed in the longer term, if they can learn fast enough. The approach allows managers to keep inexperienced teams on a short leash while they learn how to deliver effectively. Agile is a great way to reduce delivery risk caused by inexperience. Agile creates self-calibrating teams that know the limits of their capabilities.

Agile forces expert teams to confront their lack of understanding of the complex problems they are trying to solve. Agile helps expert teams explore the problem space by allowing them to innovate in small chunks and  incrementally evolve a solution.   

In practice most teams are experts at some things and beginners at others. This ability to help both Novice and Expert teams incrementally improve and create better solutions is the key to the success of Agile. 

**Avoiding the Agile Cargo Cult**

The conditions that favor the Agile approach do not universally apply. The [HBR Article Embracing Agile](https://hbr.org/2016/05/embracing-agile) points out it is important to "understand where agile does or does not work." Not all initiatives require innovation. Some merely require a solid implementation of a well understood design.  

> Agile is not a panacea. It is most effective and easiest to implement under conditions commonly found in software innovation: The problem to be solved is complex; solutions are initially unknown, and product requirements will most likely change; the work can be modularized; close collaboration with end users (and rapid feedback from them) is feasible; and creative teams will typically outperform command-and-control groups.

Even when Agile is applicable, there are multiple flavors, each suited for different purposes. [Disciplined Agile (DA)](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/) is a process decision framework that provides guidance to organizations struggling with deciding which Agile Practices to adopt. 

> In general, Disciplined Agile (DA) is a hybrid framework that builds upon the solid foundation of other methods and software process frameworks.  DAD adopts practices and strategies from existing sources and provides advice for when and how to apply them together.
> [Introduction to Disciplined Agile](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/introduction-to-dad/)

With an objective assessment of the needs, capabilities, and constraints of a business, and the problem it is trying to solve, it is usually possible to tailor a successful Agile approach. Tailoring the approach is not that easy, but [Disciplined Agile (DA)](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/)  does a reasonable job of providing guidance.    

**Goals and Objectives**

This then is Agile's Achilles heal. It is the interplay of business objectives and constraints, with user needs, and technically achievablity that shapes all solutions. Consciously attempting to asses and define these factors is the foundation of successful system development. Agile is silent on this. There is no principle or practice regarding the obvious need to define goals and objectives. Outcomes matter far more than features. Agile offers no guidance on how these objectives must be used to filter and interpret user feedback. Most concerning, Agile has nothing to say on how to address the omni present business objective to deliver a viable set of features by a particular date for a pre-approved budget. In fact many Agile methodologies claim this is the wrong way to frame the problem. The best that most Agile methodologies can do is to offer a trite promise to deliver "value" without defining what that is.  
 
Filipe Castro does a nice job of defining the [OKR (Objectives and Key Results)](http://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/) approach to goal setting, and further explains how OKRs can be used for Agile Development.

> OKR (Objectives and Key Results) is a goal setting framework adopted by Silicon Valley companies that can complement Agile and Lean, creating an agile approach for setting goals and measuring value. Used by Google, Twitter and LinkedIn, OKR can help evolve the Agile Community and the Agile Manifesto itself from a focus on outputs (delivering features) to a focus on outcomes (delivering results).

I spend a lot of my time these days talking with product managers and principal engineers about goals and objectives for their projects. What are they trying to achieve, and why? Usually we define a handful of goals and objectives and the outline of a solution in a 3 to 5 day project inception workshop, we then elaborate the design in the first few iterations. Throughout the initiative we check back against the objectives to make sure we are not straying from the goal. Obviously Objectives can and do change, sometimes half-way through an initiative. But having them written down allows us to quickly identify when they are changing and adapt accordingly.
