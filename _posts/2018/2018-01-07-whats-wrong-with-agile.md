I talk to a lot of people about Agile, everyone has an opinion, often contradictory. Expecting consistency is probably unrealistic, anything based on a Manifesto is a political movement, not an engineering discipline. Many of the people I talk to adhere to Agile dogma with religious conviction. Just like conversations with Marxists, or Libertarians, it gets tiring trying to discuss alternatives with true believers. Zealots don't tollerate deviation from the one path. (spoiler alert! If you are one of those Zealots you might not like what I have to say)

The Agile movement has revolutionized the development of software. It is clearly better than traditional alternatives. It works, mostly! Organizations representing the full range of industries, business models, and sizes are using Agile. They aren't all  doing it the same way. I've personally seen many varients of the approach with differing outcomes and benefits. But I've not seen a single company planning on giving it up, and most that are not already using it are trying, or planning, to adopt it. 

Even when organizations don't follow a particular Agile flavor religiously, even when they  don't do it "right", they still get benefit. Something strange is going on. Why is the Agile approach so robustly effective, despite so much abuse and mis-implementation. Why has it become so popular that disciplines outside of software development, like marketing, are starting to adopt it?

The practices and pinciples emboddied in the Agile approach existed long before the [Agile Manifesto (2001)](http://agilemanifesto.org/). In his 1988 book The Principles of Software engineering Management [Tom Gilb](https://www.gilb.com/) dedicated a chapter to Evolutionary Delivery in which he describes the critical concepts of of an Evolutionary Delivery approach as 

> 1. Multi-objective driven
2. Early, frequent itteration
3. Complete analysis, design, build and test in each step
4. User orientation
5. Systems approach, not merely algorithm orientation
6. Open-ended basic systems architecture
7. Results orientation, not software development process orientation 

These overlap significantly with Agile Principles. Gilb himself quotes even earlier work by Demming. There are other examples of Agile like approaches in the engineering history books. The approach has clearly been evolving for many years, it has existed in various forms long before it was codified. But it seems to have now reached a new level of maturity and effectiveness that have caused it to spill out of software development into more mainstream business practices.

Several factors seem to be driving its spread 

**Agile is Human Scale and Transparent**

Each individual on an agile team can see how their contribution, and that of their peers, create value. Agile teams are small enough that each individual can have a positive impact, and no individual can hide their weaknesses. Time scales are short enough for feedback to be meaningful and actionable. The team can individually, and collectively, learn from it's mistakes, hopefully, fast enough to make a difference. People who like teamwork like Agile. 

**Agile is Easy to Explain and Self-Correcting**

It is easy to communicate the basic principles and practices. It is much harder to explain why these practices work. The benefits of the approach are emmergent - practices interact in various ways to create benefits that are not predictable before hand. This is why so many zealots demand complete adherence to their flavor of Agile - they can't explain how the benefits arrise from the practices, because they emerge from a complex interaction of many factors. In practice it doesn't much matter where you start. Not only do the practices lead to emergent benefits, they act as an attractor that pulls and pushes teams toward an ever more effective Approach. The practices are valuable individually and are self-reinforcing, becoming even more valueable collectively. You may not get the "full" value till you implement them all, but you will get significant value. This is not luck or an accident, this collection of practices have been co-evolving for many years. They work well together. 

**Agile Drives the Evolution of Solutions and Teams**

Agile can be employed to evolve better solutions in a rapidly changing environment of uncertain goals, objectives, and requirements. But there is more than one reason why a team may lack a clear understanding of what it is trying to achieve. 

When a novice team is uncertain of how to deliver a well understood solution an agile approach forces the team to continually confront their own lack of skill, to fail in small recoverable steps, thus allowing them to succeed in the longer term, if they can learn fast enough. The approach allows managers to keep inexperienced teams on a short leash while they learn how to deliver effectively. Agile is a great way to reduce delivery risk caused by inexperience. Agile creates self-calibrating teams that know the limits of their capabilities.

Agile forces expert teams to confront their lack of understanding of the complex problems they are trying to solve. Agile helps expert teams explore the problem space by allowing them to innovate in small chunks and  incrementally evolve a solution. This is usually how Agile is "sold", but this benefit is only really acessible to more experienced teams.  

This ability to help both Novice and Expert teams incrimentally improve and create better solutions is the key to the sucess of Agile. 

**Avoiding the Agile Cargo Cult**

The conditions that favor the Agile approach do not universally apply. The [HBR Article Embracing Agile](https://hbr.org/2016/05/embracing-agile) points out it is important to "understand where agile does or does not work." Not all software development projects require innovation. Some merely require a solid implementation of a well understood design.  

> Agile is not a panacea. It is most effective and easiest to implement under conditions commonly found in software innovation: The problem to be solved is complex; solutions are initially unknown, and product requirements will most likely change; the work can be modularized; close collaboration with end users (and rapid feedback from them) is feasible; and creative teams will typically outperform command-and-control groups.
> [HBR Article Embracing Agile](https://hbr.org/2016/05/embracing-agile)

Even when Agile is applicable, there are multiple flavors, each suited for different purposes. [Disciplined Agile (DA)](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/) is a process decision framework that provides guidance to organizations struggling with deciding which flavor of agile to use. 

> In general, Disciplined Agile (DA) is a hybrid framework that builds upon the solid foundation of other methods and software process frameworks.  DAD adopts practices and strategies from existing sources and provides advice for when and how to apply them together.
> [Introduction to Disciplined Agile](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/introduction-to-dad/)

With an objective assesment of the needs, capabilities, and constraints of the business, and the problem they are trying to solve, it is usually possible to tailor a successful Agile approach. Tailoring the approach is not that easy, but the [Disciplined Agile (DA)](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/) site does a reasonable job of providing guidance.    

**Goals and Objectives**

It is the interplay of business objectives and constraints, with user needs, and technically achievablity that shapes all solutions. Conciously attempting to asses and define these factors is the foundation of sucessful system development. Agile is silent on this. There is no principle or practice regading the obvious need to define goals and objectives. It offers no guidance on how these factors must be used to filter and interpret user feedback. Most concerning, Agile has nothing to say on how to address the omni present business objective to deliver a viable set of features by a particular date for a pre-approved budget. In fact many Agile methodologies claim this is the wrong way to approach the problem. The best that most Agile methodolgies can do is to offer a trite promise to deliver "value" without defining what that is. This is Agile's biggest weakness. 
 
Filipe Castro does a nice job of defining the [OKR (Objectives and Key Results)](http://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/) approach to goal setting, and further explains how OKRs can be used for Agile Development.

> OKR (Objectives and Key Results) is a goal setting framework adopted by Silicon Valley companies that can complement Agile and Lean, creating an agile approach for setting goals and measuring value. Used by Google, Twitter and LinkedIn, OKR can help evolve the Agile Community and the Agile Manifesto itself from a focus on outputs (delivering features) to a focus on outcomes (delivering results).

**Initiative Inception and Rough Design up Front**

The leaner Agile adherents advocate emergent design over design up front. Using emergent design, features are built incrementally, one itteration at a time, and continually refactored, based on feedback, until a design emerges. This approach assumes the product manager and technical lead on a project are "blind watch makers" incapable of using their professional judgement to make  sound strategic decisions about the solution more than one itteration into the future. Of course this is nonsense. When armed with well defined goals and objectives, experienced lead software engineers and product managers can develop strategies and designs for the solution that employ tried and tested concepts and tactics. Incrementally evolving a design is perverse, if a design that is fit for purpose can be roughly defined upfront. Skilled professionals are more than capabable of anticipating obvious opportunities and avoiding predictable problems. 

As the HBR article states if "similar work has been done before, and innovators believe the solutions are clear [then] detailed specifications and work plans can be forecast with confidence..."  In such circumstances significant parts of a solution can, and should, be specified up front. Not every project is so innovative that is must be evolved from scratch. In fact most are not. Experienced Product Managers and Technical Leads can usually create a rough outline for 40 to 80 % of a solution in the first few itterations of a project. This Rough Design Up Front (RDUF) is another crucial part of pragmatic system design that is underrepresented in Agile. It should be noted that several Agile methodologies do allow for an inception phase in which objectives and a rough design can be created before the main construction begins.  

I spend a lot of my time these days talking with product managers and principle engineers about goals and objectives for their projects. What are they trying to achieve, and why? How much of a design is already understood, or can be understood, faster than it can be evolved. Usually we define the goals and objectives and preliminary solution in a 3 to 5 day project inception workshop, then expand on the design in the first few itterations. After that I'm a Lean Agile Zealot but not before.
